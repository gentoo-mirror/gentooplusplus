		<description>AsyncGui

...is a minimalistic async library that:

    does not provide features involving system calls, such as I/O, time retrieval, thread suspension, or thread spawning.
    has no external dependencies when using Python 3.11 or later.
    does not own a main loop, but is designed to integrate with an existing one.
    avoids global state.
    focuses on fast responsiveness, allowing immediate task start and resumption.
    offers powerful structured concurrency APIs inspired by Trio and trio-util.
    has nothing to do with GUIs, even though it has 'gui' in its name.
